# PREPARE OUR REGEXES FOR METADATA SEARCHES #
# we'll use re.compile() here, which allows you to assign a regex pattern
# to a variable. We'll do this for each our metadata fields.
#
# Also note how we're using paretheses to create two search groups. Looking
# at title_search, see how we use one group to match on the presence of "title:".
#
# Also, note how in the second group is a named group -- we use ?p<name> .
#
# Finally, note that we're passing the re.IGNORECASE flag as an optional
# argument to re.compile. We're doing this because it's human beings who create
# the metadata headers at the top of Project gutenberg docs, and we want to account
# for possibility of "title: Some Title", "Title: Some Title", and "TITLE: Some Title").

# Breakdown of title regex:
# (?:title:\s*)- grab the word 'title' followed by a colon and any number of space
# characters. The '?:' insures this group is not captured.
# (?P<title>- Capture a group named 'title'
# [\s\S]- get any space or non-space character
# (?!\n.+:)- not followed by a newline, one or more non-newline characters, and a colon
# *- and grab zero or more of these characters.
title_search = re.compile(r'(?:title:\s*)(?P<title>([\s\S](?!\n.+:))*)', re.IGNORECASE)
author_search = re.compile(r'(author:)(?P<author>.*)', re.IGNORECASE)
translator_search = re.compile(r'(translator:)(?P<translator>.*)', re.IGNORECASE)
illustrator_search = re.compile(r'(illustrator:)(?P<illustrator>.*)', re.IGNORECASE)
# This works, but I'm also getting the first '***' at the end of MAG_CART.
# I had hoped the (\*{3}\s*)+ would capture any number of those plus the
# trailing space characters.
doc_body_search = re.compile(r'(?:\*{3}\s*START.*\n+)(?P<body>[\s\S]*)(?:[\n\r]+\s*(\*{3}\s*)+END)')

# now iterate over the documents and extract and print output about metadata
# for each one. Note the use of enumerate here, which gives you a counter variable
# (in this case 'i') that keeps track of the index of the list (in this case documents)
# your currently on in your loop. You should memorize how enumerate works, and google it
# if you need more explanation. It's a highly productive built in function, and there are
# common problems that you'll encounter as a programmer that enumerate is great for.
